## Features in Comparision to DWA

1) **Lightweight** : Since it does not sample in comparision to DWA, and uses a simple controller, it is much lightweight.
2) **In place rotation** : It can reach the navigation goal if the goal orientation is 180 degree away.


## Usage

Clone and catkin_make it.

Replace **pd_controller/PDController** to your default mo0ve base params.
